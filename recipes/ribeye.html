        <h2>The Reverse Sear Method</h2>
        <p>The Reverse Sear Method is an innovative take on the ordinary sear method.  Instead of searing the steak before finishing off the steak in the oven, the reverse sear method starts the ribeye off in the oven.  After the desired internal temperature is reached (depending on done-ness), the steak is seared at a very high temperature on a piping how cast iron skillet.</p>
